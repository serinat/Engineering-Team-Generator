### Engineering-Team-Generator

- The objective of this homework was to create a command line application that creates a team roster consisting our desired number of engineers and interns under one manager. The process involved running npm install and node app.js to prompt the user to pick a role and provide the ID, email and github for the engineer and ID, email and school of intern, and finally to display the team roster on an html page. I was able to develop the file structure including node_modules, package json, JS files for employee, manager, engineer & intern, and the main, manager, engineer & intern html templates. Unforunately, after creating different scenarios for the app.js functions, I wasn't able to get my application to work. I may have been thinking too hard and trying to implement too many things which led me to this unfinished product. Even though the homework is due, and I did not have enough time to complete, my plan is to finish during this Thanksgiving holiday break.
